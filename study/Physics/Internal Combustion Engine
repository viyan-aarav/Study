The Internal Combustion Engine

Engine Block

The Engine Block is the base of an engine and it is usually made out of aluminium it is also called the cylinder block because the cylinders are put into the integrated structure.
The cylinder is where the engine pistons go up and down the more cylinders an engine has the more powerful it is and apart from the cylinders other passageways and ducts are built into the engine block for oil and coolant to go to the different parts of the engine.

V6 & V8

In four cylinder engines the cylinders are usually in a straight line above the crankshaft this layout is called an inline engine and in the flat 
four layout the cylinders are laid horizontally in two banks with the crankshaft in the middle.
When an engine has more than four cylinders they are split into two cylinder banks three or more cylinders are on each side and that makes it look like a V so if an engine has six cylinders with a V-shaped engine = V6 and V8 is the same thing but with four on each side.
